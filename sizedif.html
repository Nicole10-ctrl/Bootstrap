    <h3>Differentiate between pixel, percentage and rem in CSS</h3>

    <p>pixel
        Their key difference lies in whether they are absolute or relative and what they are relative to.
1. Pixel (px):
Absolute Unit: Pixels are an absolute unit of measurement, meaning their value is fixed and does not change based on other elements or the user's browser settings.
Fixed Size: A 16px font size will always be 16 pixels, regardless of the parent element's font size or the root HTML element's font size.
Use Cases: Ideal for elements that require a precise, fixed size, like borders, small icons, or images where consistent dimensions are crucial.
2. Percentage (%):
Relative Unit: Percentages are a relative unit, meaning their value is calculated based on the size of their parent element.
Parent-Dependent: A width: 50% means the element will take up 50% of its parent element's width. If the parent's width changes, the element's width will also adjust proportionally.
Use Cases: Excellent for creating fluid and responsive layouts where elements need to adapt to the size of their containing element, often used for widths, heights, padding, and margins.
3. Root Em (rem):
Relative Unit: rem stands for "root em" and is a relative unit that scales based on the font-size of the root HTML element (the <html> tag).
Root-Dependent: If the font-size of the <html> element is set to 16px, then 1rem will equal 16px. If the root font-size is changed to 20px, then 1rem will become 20px.
Accessibility and Scalability: rem is particularly useful for typography and spacing as it allows for easy scaling of the entire design by simply adjusting the root font-size. This significantly improves accessibility for users who prefer larger or smaller text sizes.
Use Cases: Recommended for defining global font sizes, consistent spacing, and elements that should scale uniformly with the user's preferred text size, regardless of their parent's specific font size.
